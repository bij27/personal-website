            <p>Hello there! Iâ€™m Bijan. Let me tell you a bit about me...</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, but I currently reside in Chicago.</p>
            <p>I have a ton of interests and passions, most of which have carried over into my adulthood from my adolescence.</p>
            <p>I like to consider myself a huge history buff, but my first love has always been writing. I've been writing short stories, music, poems, and screenplays since I was in middle school.</p>
            <p>In college, I pursued those hobbies further and earned a creative writing certificate, got a short story published for the first time ever in 
              the local college newspaper, and filmed a handful of short films - one of which earned me my first ever film festival win!
            <p>Personally, I think it's important to nurture the child you once were. Everyone owes it to themselves to at least try to accomplish
              a childhood goal. Small, personal accomplishments like these keep my fire lit. I never cared about fame, my intent has always been to prove myself to myself.</p>
            <p>That same mentality and curiosity has allowed me to open new doors and explore the world around me time and again.</p>
