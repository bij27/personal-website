              Born in Santa Monica and raised on the westside of Los Angeles, I
              grew up a curious and artsy kid.

            <h3>Storytelling fascinated me at a young age.</h3>

            <h3>
              I used to play make believe with my friends and siblings regularly
              and come up with enthralling stories for my toys - my imagination
              knew no boundaries. As I got older, I decided to refine my skills
              and started creative writing. I wrote short stories, songs,
              poetry, and screenplays. I never wanted to be famous, but I did
              want a personal achievement in the craft that I loved - one that
              no one could take away from me. I was able to accomplish that goal
              sooner that I anticipated.
            </h3>

            <h3>
              In my freshman year of college, I submitted a short story to the
              local college newspaper - and it got selected! I was so proud of
              the story, but none of my friends or family
